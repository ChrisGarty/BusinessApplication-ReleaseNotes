### Enable self-troubleshooting 



Self-troubleshooting makes it easier for administrators and survey designers to
identify issues with the configuration of surveys. Validation tests verify the
survey configuration or the survey itself, depending on the context. Results are
displayed on-screen with the option to download a log file.
