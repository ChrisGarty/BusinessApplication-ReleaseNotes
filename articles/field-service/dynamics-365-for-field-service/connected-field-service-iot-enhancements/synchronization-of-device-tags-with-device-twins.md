#### Synchronization of device tags with device twins

Device twin tags allow grouping of devices to make them easier to search and
find. Tags for device twins are created in Connected Field Service, and then
converted into JSON that is understood by a device.

Tags make it easy to group by device usage, identification, or other properties.
For example, customer assets needing a similar repair can be grouped using a
tag.
