### Hide pages from reading mode



A report author can hide a page from view of the report consumer until the
report is accessed via a drill‑through or bookmark action. This capability is
helpful for reports with many pages that should be hidden from the user unless
accessed within context. This capability is familiar to users who use Excel and
PowerPoint.
