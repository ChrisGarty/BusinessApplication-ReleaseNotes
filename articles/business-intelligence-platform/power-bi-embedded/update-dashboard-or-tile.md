### Update dashboard or tile



Provides improved ALM capabilities by enabling changes in the dashboard or tile
that were already deployed while retaining their original IDs. After a dashboard
or a tile is updated to a newer version, the developer can deploy the update
into production dashboards by using the **updateTile** API and stating the
source and target tiles. The content of the tile is updated without changing the
IDs, making the update smooth and fast.
