### Canvas apps support storing 20mb of data locally on Android and iOS



Apps using SaveData/LoadData pattern for building offline enabled apps on
PowerApps can now save 20mb of data in a single SaveData/LoadData call. This
should enable common use cases like capturing images offline which are then
uploaded to the service later.
