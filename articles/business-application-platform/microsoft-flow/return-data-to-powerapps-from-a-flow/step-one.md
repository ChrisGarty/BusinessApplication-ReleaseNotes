#### Step One

To set up a flow that calls data from PowerApps, first start your flow with the
PowerApps trigger.

Next, add whatever actions you want to run when your flow is called. Inside
these actions you can use the **Ask in PowerApps** option to collect additional
parameters from the PowerApp.
