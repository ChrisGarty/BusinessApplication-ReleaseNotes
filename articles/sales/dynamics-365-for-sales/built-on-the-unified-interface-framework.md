### Built on the Unified Interface framework



Because the app relies on the Unified Interface framework, the user experience
follows consistent, familiar patterns making it easier for salespeople to get up
and running quickly and be more productive. The interface is responsive and
accessible.

All controls on the user interface have been designed to improve usability.
