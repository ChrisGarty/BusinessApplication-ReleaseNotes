### Regulatory service – Configuration<br>(Public Preview)



(Available at the end of April) Regulatory service targets a no-code programming
approach, allowing users to configure Electronic reporting formats or tax rules
rather than write code for them in the underlying application. Partners and
customers using multiple versions of Finance and Operations and earlier versions
(such as Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 or Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, for India
only) can work with one configuration service to produce configurations for use
across the various versions that they are using. With the Public Preview
release, customers and partners can access Regulatory service as an independent
service through a browser.

They will have access to:

-   Electronic reporting and tax visual designers that let them create
    configurations for electronic document formats and tax calculation rules in
    accordance with country/region regulatory requirements.

-   Metadata capabilities that provide the ability to import a description of
    the target application’s artifacts, such as data tables, enumeration, and
    classes. These are used at design time to define data sources of a data
    model mapping version.
