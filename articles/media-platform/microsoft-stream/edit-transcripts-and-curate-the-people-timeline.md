### Edit transcripts and curate the people timeline



Microsoft Stream generates automatic transcripts for videos by using AI to
convert speech to text. Automatically generated transcripts can be corrected
through inline editing.

Microsoft Stream automatically detects the people in a video and builds a
timeline view showing where they appeared. Owners of the video can curate these
timelines by hiding extra people or merging two timelines into one with a
built-in inline editor.
