#  Accessibility




[!include[banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Accessibility is a top priority for many organizations, often to meet regulatory
requirements, but also because it is an important part of driving productivity
through digital transformation.

The Spring ’18 release includes investments that support our commitment to
inclusive design in Dynamics 365. Accessibility capabilities are built in so
organizations can accelerate digital inclusion and make it easier for users to
create and consume content, whether they have disabilities or just don’t have
access to a mouse or monitor.
