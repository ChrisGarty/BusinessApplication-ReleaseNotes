### Default dates



Dates are no longer completed by default for hire, transfer, and termination
processes. This reduces mistakes caused by accepting defaults that don't apply.
Also, when hiring a new worker and entering a future hire date, the worker page
opens as of the future hire date for correct date-effective entries.
