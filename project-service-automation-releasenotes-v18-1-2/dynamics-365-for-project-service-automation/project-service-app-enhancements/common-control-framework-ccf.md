#### Common Control Framework (CCF) 

User interface controls use a Common Controls Framework (CCF) for consistency
with other Dynamics 365 business applications. Controls follow consistent,
familiar patterns on every surface in the application, making it easier for
Project Service users to onboard and be productive.
